You might had better test production before submitting jobs on Grid.
eg.
echo /afs/cern.ch/work/y/yshimoga/public/mc16_13TeV/DAOD_TOPQ1.17829149._001503.pool.root.1 > infile_mc16a.txt

## Nevent -> you should change NEvent to ~1000.
top-xaod generic_config_LQ_sys_mc16a.txt infile_mc16a.txt

It will crush while its running due to some errors about root or c++
